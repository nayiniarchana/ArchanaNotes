In the context of SQL and database systems, here's an explanation of each of these data types:

1. **INT**: Represents a standard integer value, typically 4 bytes in size.
   
2. **SMALLINT**: Stores smaller integer values than `INT`, usually 2 bytes in size.

3. **TINYINT**: Holds a very small integer value, often 1 byte in size.

4. **MEDIUMINT**: Accommodates medium-sized integer values, typically 3 bytes in size.

5. **BIGINT**: Stores large integer values, larger than `INT`, usually 8 bytes in size.

6. **DECIMAL (n,d)**: A fixed-point numeric type where `n` represents the total number of digits that can be stored (precision) and `d` represents the number of digits to the right of the decimal point (scale). It's commonly used for financial calculations where precision is crucial.

7. **FLOAT**: Represents a floating-point number with single precision. It stores approximate numeric values and requires 4 bytes of storage.

8. **DOUBLE**: Represents a floating-point number with double precision, offering higher precision than `FLOAT`. It typically requires 8 bytes of storage.

9. **BIT**: Represents a fixed-length bit field. It's commonly used to store boolean values (true/false, 1/0) or other data where each bit represents a specific attribute or flag. The storage size depends on the number of bits specified, such as BIT(1), BIT(2), etc.

These data types provide flexibility in choosing the appropriate storage size and precision based on the requirements of your database schema and the nature of data being stored.
